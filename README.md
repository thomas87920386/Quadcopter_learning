# Quadcopter_learning
The repository will contain the relative knowledge and the practice around the quadcopter.

The practice of sensors is introduced. The first practice is MPU6050, which is the sensor including the IMU and the accelerator. The other practice of sensors or the algorithms around the quadcopter may be introduced in the future.
