# Quadcopter_learning
The repository will contain the relative knowledge and the practice around the quadcopter.

The repository will introduce how to use the sensors, which are used in the quadcopter, and the related algorithm. The first practice is IMU, MPU6050, which is the sensor including the gyroscope and the accelerometer. The other practice of sensors or the algorithms around the quadcopter may be introduced in the future.
